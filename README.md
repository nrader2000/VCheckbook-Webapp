# VCheckbook-Webapp
This repo contains all the content for my Node.js site!

How I locally test:

Make sure Node is installed on your machine.
Open these source files in some editor with access to a terminal (I personally use Visual Studio Code)
cd over to /nodeapp within my source files
npm start
type localhost:3000 in your prefered browser
