# VCheckbook-Webapp
This repo contains all the content for my Node.js site!

How I locally test:
1. Make sure Node is installed on your machine.
2. Open these source files in some editor with access to a terminal (I personally use Visual Studio Code)
3. cd over to /nodeapp within my source files
4. npm start
5. type localhost:3000 in your prefered browser
